Bird Watcher
============

This is a little Sinatra app that will listen to Twitter for tweets containing certain terms and then display images from those tweets. I'm building this to let people tag pictures to live display at my [wedding](http://daveandeileen.com) and it will probably exist at photos.daveandeileen.com eventually (or something like that).

Most of the hard work in the app is done with [Tweetstream](https://github.com/tweetstream/tweetstream).
